# BlackJackGame
blackjack game for csci-40
1. Creation of a method of entertainment from gambling. We wanted to make something with random number generation
and realized that gambling is filled with random numbers. This blackjack game's key features functions for random number generation
(for a player and the dealer), as well as hit/stand/splitting in the game. 
2. The fundamental constructs used are if statements, while loops, and for loops. No there were no alternative approaches that
we considered. 
3. We used a variety of methods such as debugging, and purposefully trying to break the code with unusual player inputs.
When looking into the user interface, we used numbers as responses to options, and realize that we should include users who
expected the input to be valid. Throughout the coding process, we tested with different valid inputs as to see how far our program
would continue, and some even broke the program when attempting to open files.

5. Challenges we faced were the making of serveral programs that just didn't work and lots of inconsistent programming.
What we learned with programming was the idea of debugging, really looking into the code and understanding how modularized code
was easier to debug, and making it a lesson in writing modularizing your code. 
6. If we had more time, we would include the option for multiple players like a table top game where you could play against
your friends on the same computer

  Peer Evaluation: Given $1000 dollars, I'd give nick 600 and keep 400 for myself. He started the groundwork for this project when I only had the idea. When we wrote code together, largely it would become unused, but certain bits of modularized code was used to frankenstien our code a little and lay the groundwork. I did more work on the general design rather than the indepth code. While Nick wrote a bit of code, I was often debugging or fixing small to large errors that slipped past by Nick
